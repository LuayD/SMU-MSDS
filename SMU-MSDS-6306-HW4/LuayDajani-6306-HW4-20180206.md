## Questions 2: FiveThirtyEight Data Summary

    , "\nThe numbers of column in this data set are: "  
    , length(names(df))
)
```

```
## Again, the column names include the following:
##  rank major_code major major_category total sample_size men women sharewomen employed employed_fulltime employed_parttime employed_fulltime_yearround unemployed unemployment_rate p25th median p75th college_jobs non_college_jobs low_wage_jobs 
## The numbers of column in this data set are:  21
```

### 2b: give the unique listing for major categories in the df and frequency they show up


```r
#print column names and Number

major_count
```

```
##                         major_category freq

        , main="Recent College Grads & Categories for Majors"
